      "I really didn't like Midsommar that much, but the cinematography and realistic gore were some of the best. The beginning scene where she >!learns of her parents suicide!< is far and above the most realistic grieving scene I've ever seen in a movie.\n",
      "COMMENT\n",
      "I thought Midsommar & Hereditary were both really really BAD. I felt hoodwinked, cheated, and very annoyed that I had wasted my time with them.

      "Yeah, it didn’t click for me either. I appreciated the cinematography to an extent, but for me there just wasn’t a “pay-off.” Likewise, I don’t think I could get myself to sit through it again any time soon. I desperately want to one day understand the affection some people have for it, though.\n",

      "I dont think its a bad film I just didn't connect with the main character at all. Technically, it's marvelous. Has some really fantastic camerawork and the dream sequences and editing are all amazing, but I could never get over the hurdle of disliking the main character.\n",
      "COMMENT\n",
      "I thought the ending was a bit arbitrary. The film wasn’t saying much throughout the runtime, and resorted to a wtf ending for shock value. It didn’t really contribute much to the plot. Though this is just my opinion.\n",

      "I love it as a horror because; unlike a lot of horrors it also has great writing, and defiantly leaves room for discussion while scaring you (me) by constantly putting you on edge and making you wonder what’s going to happen next. They also use the awkward conversations so well to make everything tense while also using different creative camera angles to isolate certain characters to give a certain loneliness to them and making the shots eerie at the same time.\n",

      "I’m gonna be honest, I just don’t really enjoy it. I definitely think Spike Lee has much better films including Do the Right Thing, Bamboozled, American Utopia, etc. and I feel like I just didn’t feel very connected to the characters. Whenever something happened I didn’t really feel for any of them. I defiantly think it’s a good watch if you want to then watch his other films to see how he grew as a filmmaker, but I just didn’t really like it that much.\n",

      "Yeah I definitely get how you could see it as that, personally I think while the shock value is a big part of why they put it in the film, I also think it does play a bigger part of the film and is important to the themes of the film.

I’m still a big fan of newer films like Wes Anderson’s, a lot of animated stuff, and Edgar Wright’s, I just usually don’t follow newer director’s film careers as much as i do watch their individual movies.\n",
