That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data.\\xa0Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\\n\\nThis Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it. We encourage you to read their privacy policies and know your privacy rights before interacting with them.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n    \\n            \\n                Your Privacy Rights at Apple\\n\\n                \\n            \\n\\n            \\n                \\n    \\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tAt Apple, we respect your ability to know, access, correct, transfer, restrict the processing of, and delete your personal data. We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Apple does not sell your data including as “sale” is defined in Nevada and California.\\xa0\\n\\nTo exercise your privacy rights and choices, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com for Apple or shazam.com/privacy for Shazam.

We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.\\n\\nIf you live in California, if you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page, you or your authorized agent can make a request at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact\\xa0or by calling 1-800-275-2273.\\n\\nFor more information on exercising your rights, visit support.apple.com/kb/HT208501.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n    \\n            \\n                Personal Data Apple Collects from You\\n\\n                \\n            \\n\\n            \\n                \\n    \\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tAt Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy.

These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\\n\\n\\tCommunications Cookies. These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple’s systems, including by helping us detect any errors.\\n\\tStrictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at apple.com.\\xa0\\n\\tOther Cookies. These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Apple also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIf you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, choose “Block all cookies” in Safari’s privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Apple website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.\\n\\nIn addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.\\xa0\\n\\nIn some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.\\n\\nApple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as nonpersonal data. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines nonpersonal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.\\n\\nAds that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News, Stocks, or in the App Store. If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple\\'s advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS or iPadOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by choosing Apple menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy, clicking Privacy, clicking Advertising, and deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n    \\n            \\n                Transfer of Personal Data Between Countries\\n\\n                \\n            \\n\\n            \\n                \\n    \\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tApple products and offerings connect you to the world.

For example, retail store information is controlled by individual retail entities in each country and Apple Media Services-related personal data may be controlled by various Apple entities as reflected in the terms of service. If you do not reside in the U.S., your personal data may be processed by Apple Inc. on behalf of the Apple entity controlling personal data for your jurisdiction.

LinkedIn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tShare on Pinterest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nIn an effort to commemorate its country\\'s progress in a specific sector of the fruit industry, KAMEI DESIGN, a Japanese company, created an unusual apple-inspired stool. \\n\\n\\n\\nIn order to do this, designer Takaaki Kamei considered the ladders that those picking the fruit would use, as well as the product they gathered. The latter element is depicted on the seat of the apple-inspired stool, where a cluster of flattened spheres make it look similar to a bundle of the fruit. KAMEI DESIGN was aided on this front by the Kimura Woodcraft Factory. \\n\\n\\n\\nAs a means to pay tribute to Japan\\'s history in the industry more closely, the stool makes use of \"Hiba Cypress trees found in Aomori  -- a prefecture located in the northern parts of Japan.\" \\n\\nPhoto Credits: designboom, kameidesign.jp\\n2.7\\nScore\\n\\nPopularity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nActivity\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFreshness\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nVIEW MORE STATS expand_moreGET A CUSTOM REPORTSUBSCRIBE TO ADVISORY\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGet the 2021 Trend Report FREE\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPro Services\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tInnovation Accelerator\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tInnovation Keynotes\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTrend Reports\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCustom Dashboards\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFuture Festival\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFree Resources\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tInnovation Videos & Books\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tInnovation Assessment\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tWeekly Trend Report\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNEW: 2021 Trend Report\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGet a FREE Report\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTransformative Office Furniture\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCORALS is Furniture for the Modern Office Space\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFlat-Pack Dog Beds\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\'Klaffer\\' is a Doggie Version of Nils Holger Moorman\\'s Popular \\'Siebenschlafer\\'\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic-Influenced Furniture\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThis New Furniture Collection is Inspired By Omani Design Traditions\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAdjustable Cushion Sofas\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Mellow Sofa by Océane Delain is Customizable for Optimal Comfort\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t25 Two-in-One Home Furnishings\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tThese Multipurpose Designs Maximize the Potential for Small Spaces\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTop 100 Modern Trends of 2016\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFrom Freestanding Tea Houses to Upcycled Office Scraps\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVIEW MORE RELATED\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAbout Us & Contact \\xa0 \\xa0 \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tInnovation Keynote Speaker \\xa0  \\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBest Innovation Conference \\xa0  \\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tCustom Trend Reports\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTrends Ⓒ 2021  TREND HUNTER Inc.   \\xa0   \\xa0\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tTerms of Use, Copyright Info & Privacy Policy',\n",

That’s why we treat any data that relates to an identified or identifiable individual or that is linked or linkable to them by Apple as “personal data,” no matter where the individual lives. This means that data that directly identifies you — such as your name — is personal data, and also data that does not directly identify you, but that can reasonably be used to identify you — such as the serial number of your device — is personal data.\\xa0Aggregated data is considered non‑personal data for the purposes of this Privacy Policy.\\n\\nThis Privacy Policy covers how Apple or an Apple-affiliated company handles personal data whether you interact with us on our websites, through Apple apps (such as Apple Music or Wallet), or in person (including by phone or when visiting our retail stores). Apple may also link to third parties on our services or make third-party apps available for download in our App Store. Apple’s Privacy Policy does not apply to how third parties define personal data or how they use it.

We have provided these rights to our global customer base and if you choose to exercise these privacy rights, you have the right not to be treated in a discriminatory way nor to receive a lesser degree of service from Apple. Apple does not sell your data including as “sale” is defined in Nevada and California.\\xa0\\n\\nTo exercise your privacy rights and choices, visit the Apple Data and Privacy page at privacy.apple.com for Apple or shazam.com/privacy for Shazam. To help protect the security of your personal data, you must sign in to your account and your identity will be verified. If the Data and Privacy page is not available in your region, you can make privacy rights requests at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact.\\xa0\\n\\nThere may be situations where we cannot grant your request — for example, if you ask us to delete your transaction data and Apple is legally obligated to keep a record of that transaction to comply with law. We may also decline to grant a request where doing so would undermine our legitimate use of data for anti-fraud and security purposes, such as when you request deletion of an account that is being investigated for security concerns. Other reasons your privacy request may be denied are if it jeopardizes the privacy of others, is frivolous or vexatious, or would be extremely impractical.\\n\\nIf you live in California, if you cannot access Apple’s Data and Privacy page, you or your authorized agent can make a request at apple.com/legal/privacy/contact\\xa0or by calling 1-800-275-2273.\\n\\nFor more information on exercising your rights, visit support.apple.com/kb/HT208501.\\xa0\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n    \\n            \\n                Personal Data Apple Collects from You\\n\\n                \\n            \\n\\n            \\n                \\n    \\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tAt Apple, we believe that you can have great products and great privacy.

We may also use personal data for other purposes with your consent.\\xa0\\n\\nApple uses your personal data only when we have a valid legal basis to do so. Depending on the circumstance, Apple may rely on your consent or the fact that the processing is necessary to fulfill a contract with you, protect your vital interests or those of other persons, or to comply with law. We may also process your personal data where we believe it is in our or others’ legitimate interests, taking into consideration your interests, rights, and expectations.

These technologies help us to better understand user behavior including for security and fraud prevention purposes, tell us which parts of our websites people have visited, and facilitate and measure the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches.\\n\\n\\tCommunications Cookies. These cookies are used to enable network traffic to and from Apple’s systems, including by helping us detect any errors.\\n\\tStrictly Necessary Cookies. These cookies are set as required to provide a specific feature or service that you have accessed or requested. For example, they allow us to display our websites in the proper format and language, to authenticate and verify your transactions, and to preserve the contents of your Bag when shopping online at apple.com.\\xa0\\n\\tOther Cookies. These cookies are used to understand how visitors interact with our websites and online services, including by helping us to assess the effectiveness of advertisements and web searches. Apple also uses these cookies to remember choices you make while browsing, so we can provide you with a customized experience.\\xa0\\n\\n\\xa0\\n\\n\\nIf you prefer that Apple not use cookies, we provide you with the means to disable their use. If you want to disable cookies and you’re using the Safari web browser, choose “Block all cookies” in Safari’s privacy settings. If you are using a different browser, check with your provider to find out how to disable cookies. Certain features of the Apple website may not be available if all cookies are disabled.\\n\\nIn addition to cookies, Apple uses other technologies that help us achieve similar objectives.\\xa0\\n\\nIn some email messages Apple sends to you, we provide a “click-through URL” that links you to content on the Apple website. When you click one of these URLs, they pass through a separate server before arriving at the destination page on our website. We track this click-through to help us determine interest in particular topics and measure whether we are communicating with you effectively. If you prefer not to be tracked in this way, you should not click graphic or text links in email messages.\\n\\nApple generally treats data we collect using these cookies and similar technologies as nonpersonal data. However, to the extent that Internet Protocol (IP) addresses or similar identifiers are considered personal data by local law, we also treat these identifiers as personal data in those regions. In addition, Apple sometimes combines nonpersonal data collected from these technologies with other personal data Apple holds. When we combine data in this way, we treat the combined data as personal data for purposes of this Privacy Policy.\\n\\nAds that are delivered by Apple’s advertising platform may appear in Apple News, Stocks, or in the App Store. If you do not want to receive ads targeted to your interests from Apple\\'s advertising platform in those apps, you can choose to disable Personalized Ads, which will opt your Apple ID out of receiving such ads regardless of what device you are using. On your iOS or iPadOS device, you can disable Personalized Ads by going to Settings > Privacy > Apple Advertising and tapping to turn off Personalized Ads. On your Mac, you can disable Personalized Ads by choosing Apple menu > System Preferences > Security & Privacy, clicking Privacy, clicking Advertising, and deselecting Personalized Ads. You may still see ads in the App Store, Apple News, or Stocks based on context like your search query or the channel you are reading. If you disable Allow Apps to Request to Track, third-party apps cannot request to use the Advertising Identifier, a non personal identifier served by the operating system on your device, to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies.\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\n    \\n            \\n                Transfer of Personal Data Between Countries\\n\\n                \\n            \\n\\n            \\n                \\n    \\n\\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\t\\tApple products and offerings connect you to the world.

For example, retail store information is controlled by individual retail entities in each country and Apple Media Services-related personal data may be controlled by various Apple entities as reflected in the terms of service. If you do not reside in the U.S., your personal data may be processed by Apple Inc. on behalf of the Apple entity controlling personal data for your jurisdiction.

del iPhone, además de poder utilizarla para comprar productos Apple con descuento.\\nEn un evento en la sede del fabricante de Cupertino, California, la vicepresidenta para Apple Pay, Jennifer Bailey, dijo que la tarjeta de crédito funcionará a través de la aplicación \"wallet\", y que los titulares de las tarjetas pueden obtener un reembolso de un 2% en todas las compras que realicen y un 3% en productos de Apple.\\nLa tarjeta también funcionará con las nuevas características de Apple Wallet para ayudar a los consumidores a realizar un seguimiento de sus gastos y sus tendencias de compras.\\nEmitida por Mastercard a través de Goldman Sachs, el fabricante de la manzana dijo que también habrá una tarjeta física que obtendrá un reembolso de 1% en todas las compras.\\nEsta será la primera tarjeta de crédito ofrecida por Goldman Sachs, mejor conocido por ser un banco de inversión en Wall Street. Goldman ha buscado expandir sus productos orientados al consumidor y ofrece préstamos personales y cuentas de ahorro a través de su banco en línea Marcus, que ha crecido rápidamente desde el lanzamiento en 2016 y ahora cuenta con 36,000 millones de dólares en depósitos en Estados Unidos y Reino Unido, además de 5,000 millones de dólares en créditos de consumo.\\nEn el gran evento, también se lanzó \"Apple Arcade\", un servicio de suscripción a videojuegos para dispositivos móviles, computadoras y otros aparatos.\\n Apple dijo que está trabajando con Walt Disney, Sega y Annapurna Interactive en el nuevo servicio de juegos, que contará con más de 100 títulos a los que se puede acceder a través de la App Store y que funcionará en iPad, Mac y Apple TV.\\n Arcade no tendrá anuncios ni compras adicionales y permitirá a los padres administrar el tiempo de pantalla. El servicio estará disponible este otoño boreal en más de 150 países.\\nApple lanzó una nueva aplicación de Apple TV y un servicio de streaming llamado Apple TV+ en un evento en sus oficinas centrales de California.\\nUna serie de celebridades, entre ellas el director Steven Spielberg y las actrices Reese Witherspoon y Jennifer Aniston, subieron al escenario para anunciar sus programas en Apple TV+.\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tArchivado

This launch comes eight month after the app hit American markets. Inspite of its recent inception, the app is extremely popular amongst the American audience. So far, users with iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 plus will have access to this feature.\\n\\nLike Us on Facebook \\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAccording to\\xa0PC Mag, the much coveted contactless payment Apple Pay, which is exclusively for iPhone users, has made its official debut in United Kingdom. As of now, the company's tie-up will allow users to access the app in more than 250 thousand locations across the country. This includes Boots, Marks & Spencer, Nando's and many other. The biggest advantage of this app is that it will also work on London's tube and railway network.\\n\\n\\nUsing the app is easy. iPhone 6 or iPhone 6 plus users have to just hold their handset in front of the contactless reader and press the Touch ID. This will authorize the transaction process in seconds. The user, on the other hand, will get a payment confirmation as soon as the phone vibrates or notifies them with a beep.\\n\\n\\nEven those who own the latest Apple Watch will be able to use this feature. The procedure of using remains the same. This facility is expected to minimize the need to carry wallets, and in turn, also reduce the risk of being dropped or losing the change. This app is also compatible with \\xa0iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3; however, the only challenge is that the app works with in-app payment option. Users will have to select the Buy with Apple Pay option when they choose to complete a transaction with this app.\\n\\n\\nApple Pay will work with major credit cards, including Visa, MasterCard, and American Express, as well as a number of top U.K. banks. Some banks like Barclays, which already offer a contactless payment option, will also support this app. Apparently, in spite of U.K. being a smaller market, there are more locations supporting the Apple pay feature, as opposed to America, where it was originally launched, at the end of last year,\\xa0Tech Crunch\\xa0reported.\\xa0\\n\\n                       \\n                       \\n\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t TagsApple payment app, Apple Pay UK\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                    \\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n                    ©2015 Chinatopix All rights reserved.

For instance, in an emergency, you can call 911 with an iPhone to summon help. Not to mention, there have been documented cases of Apple Watch detecting undiagnosed medical conditions. People ultimately go to the doctor to follow-up, and as a result, it ends up saving their lives. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAs great as Apple devices are, they can also sometimes kill you. Like, seriously, some Apple products can possibly end your life -- if you have certain medical devices, that is, such as a pacemaker. And now, Apple is sharing a full list of its products that can interfere with medical devices and potentially lead to death. This expands upon its previously released list. \\n           Continue reading →\\n\\n      \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n      Logitech Combo Touch keyboard case turns Apple iPad Air (4th gen) into a proper laptop\\n\\n      \\n\\t\\t\\t            \\n             By Brian Fagioli\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t5 days ago\\n\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tTweet\\n\\tNo Comments\\n\\n\\n          \\n\\n      \\n\\n\\n      \\n          \\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you want the absolute best tablet computing experience, you have to get an iPad.

Trust me, y\\'all; Apple created magic with the iPad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhile iPad can\\xa0technically\\xa0serve as someone\\'s only computer without any added accessories, it does shine when you connect it to a keyboard case -- particularly one with a trackpad.

Like Microsoft\\'s Surface Pro tablets, however, balancing the kickstand on your actual lap while typing on the keyboard might be a bit frustrating.\\n           Continue reading →\\n\\n      \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n      iPhones have a weird Wi-Fi bug\\n\\n      \\n\\t\\t\\t            \\n             By Sofia Wyciślik-Wilson\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1 week ago\\n\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tTweet\\n\\tNo Comments\\n\\n\\n          \\n\\n      \\n\\n\\n      \\n          \\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA security researcher has discovered a strange iPhone bug that breaks wireless internet connectivity.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSelf-proclaimed reverse engineer Carl Schou found that simply connecting to a network with an SSID containing particular characters \"permanently disabled\" his iPhone\\'s Wi-Fi functionality.

Not only were there new\\xa0MacBook Air\\xa0and\\xa0MacBook Pro\\xa0laptops, but a new\\xa0Mac mini\\xa0desktop as well. More recently, Apple released a new M1-powered iMac too. I was fascinated by the new\\xa0Apple Silicon processors, so earlier this year, I bought my very own Mac mini. Guess what? It is a phenomenal computer that I love very much so far.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem with the Mac mini, however, is it doesn\\'t come with a keyboard or mouse. This is by design, as Apple hopes Windows users will replace their current desktops with the little Mac -- simply reusing existing keyboards, mice, and monitors. Unfortunately, a Windows keyboard is not ideal for a Mac. Will it work? Yes, but it doesn\\'t have the exact same keys, such as \"COMMAND.\" And so, Mac mini buyers would be wise to buy a Mac keyboard.\\n           Continue reading →\\n\\n      \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n      Apple launches Dr. Dre-inspired Beats Studio Buds with active noise cancellation\\n\\n      \\n\\t\\t\\t            \\n             By Brian Fagioli\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t2 weeks ago\\n\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tTweet\\n\\t1 Comment\\n\\n\\n          \\n\\n      \\n\\n\\n      \\n          \\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBeats by Dre headphones are revered around the world for their great looks and high sound quality. They are also very much respected by the Hip-Hop community as the \"Dre\" in the brand refers to Dr. Dre -- one of the greatest record producers of all time. Since Apple bought the brand, it dropped the \"by Dre\" making them simply \"Beats.\" With that said, Dr. Dre\\'s soul and inspiration will forever live on in the products.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToday, Apple launches the Dr. Dre-inspired \"Beats Studio Buds.\" These are notable for offering active noise cancellation at a very affordable price. Despite being an Apple product, the company promises fast Bluetooth pairing with both iPhone and Google\\'s Android! Beats Studio Buds offer a maximum of eight hours of listening time on their own, but the case will fully charge them twice, effectively increasing this to 24 hours.

I mean, they talked a lot. Like, for nearly two hours, various Apple employees highlighted the company\\'s plans for the future, including iOS 15 and iPadOS 15. While consumers are probably most excited about Apple\\'s aforementioned mobile operating systems, other people (such as yours truly), are more intrigued by the newest version of the desktop OS. Called \"Monterey,\" this once again looks to be the best macOS ever. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nDespite Apple switching to its own ARM-based processors for the newest Mac computers, macOS Monterey will be compatible with Intel-based machines too. Notably, Shortcuts\\xa0from iOS and iPadOS will be coming to Monterey. While Automator is still supported, it is unofficially on death-watch. Most interestingly, Apple is making it easier to work between iPhone, iPad, and Mac -- you can now do AirPlay to Mac and share your mouse and keyboard between devices with Universal Control. \\n           Continue reading →\\n\\n      \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n      Apple iOS 15 promises loads of powerful new features\\n\\n      \\n\\t\\t\\t            \\n             By Wayne Williams\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t3 weeks ago\\n\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tTweet\\n\\t1 Comment\\n\\n\\n          \\n\\n      \\n\\n\\n      \\n          \\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple’s WWDC started today and the tech giant had a lot of news covering iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFor many non-developers, the big news is going to be the changes coming to the iPhone’s mobile operating system, and iOS 15 doesn’t disappoint.\\n           Continue reading →\\n\\n      \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n      Watch Apple\\'s WWDC 2021 keynote live here today\\n\\n      \\n\\t\\t\\t            \\n             By Wayne Williams\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t3 weeks ago\\n\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tTweet\\n\\tNo Comments\\n\\n\\n          \\n\\n      \\n\\n\\n      \\n          \\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nToday is a big day for Apple as it will be opening its yearly developer conference with a virtual keynote.

If you aren\\'t familiar, it is a little battery-powered disc that is designed to track belongings. You can buy an accessory to turn it into a keychain, for instance, and then track your keys. As another example, you can buy a luggage tag accessory so you can track your bags when traveling. It is the dependence on accessories that makes the AirTag so expensive.  \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe problem, you see, is that not only can it be used to track things, but people too. Yes, creepy stalkers can secretly hide one of these AirTags inside something that belongs to another person and then track them. If the person being tracked has an iPhone, however, it will detect such behavior and warn them if it notices an AirTag (that they don\\'t own) moving around with them. \\n           Continue reading →\\n\\n      \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n      Satechi Aluminum Stand and Hub transforms Apple iPad Pro into a desktop computer\\n\\n      \\n\\t\\t\\t            \\n             By Brian Fagioli\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t4 weeks ago\\n\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tTweet\\n\\t5 Comments\\n\\n\\n          \\n\\n      \\n\\n\\n      \\n          \\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen Apple launched its now-infamous What\\'s a Computer? advertisement for the iPad Pro, it was pretty much universally panned for stupidity. In it, a woman refers to a girl\\'s iPad Pro as a computer, and the girl replies with the classic \"what\\'s a computer?\" line. As we know, an iPad is a computer, and it\\'s absurd to think the youth of America are unfamiliar with the term \"computer.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nBut what if an iPad Pro wasn\\'t just a tablet computer, but a desktop computer too?

Don\\'t get me wrong, some Bluetooth speakers will impress in the sound quality department, but those models are few and far between. Audiophiles and other lovers of music will often instead opt for wired speakers and stereo receivers -- convenience be damned. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nApple\\'s AirPlay 2 is far superior to Bluetooth, as it often provides better sound quality while operating over Wi-Fi. Yes, you can easily transmit to an AirPlay speaker as long as it is connected to the same network. The problem? AirPlay 2 speakers are rather rare. Thankfully, a new product from Belkin will transform your existing stereo receiver or speaker system into a makeshift AirPlay 2 device. \\n           Continue reading →\\n\\n      \\n\\n  \\n\\n\\n  \\n      SteelSeries Nimbus+ game controller now comes with 4 free months of Apple Arcade\\n\\n      \\n\\t\\t\\t            \\n             By Brian Fagioli\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1 month ago\\n\\n          \\n\\n          \\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\t\\n\\tTweet\\n\\tNo Comments\\n\\n\\n          \\n\\n      \\n\\n\\n      \\n          \\n          \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIf you are a fan of mobile gaming, and you own Apple hardware (such as an iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, or Mac), then you simply must check out Apple Arcade.
