      "Now let's look at the 6% - 10% sales tax that we pay across the country. You think a flat tax is fair and square? The Romney's paid 14% of their $13.7 million income into taxes last year. How much of the remaining $11. 8 million do you think they'll need to live on? 10%? 20%? What percentage of the money they spend will go toward sales tax? It's hard to say, but if they spend $1.5 million on taxable sales and they pay 6% on it, that comes to $90k or. 006% of their yearly income. (I'm sure that these are net numbers I'm playing with but, it's not really relevant because the scale is what's important.) \n",

      "For a family living on that median income or anything below it, the are going to be spending close to if not all of their income to live. That's everything. Because much more of their income is immediately spent, much more of it will be hit with sales tax. One could even argue that a 6% sales tax is effectively a 4% or 5% tax on a poor family's income. \n",

      "So currently a poor or middle class family is paying 19% of their $50k yearly income, while the Romney's are paying still 14% on $13.7 million.

      "My dad (and pretty much all of my father's side of the family) were born and raised kibbutzniks. I've been there several times and it is hardly socialistic. The kibbutzim were always this highly militaristic (there are pictures of my dad, age 8, learning how to shoot uzis at arabs), even more so if that is possible than the rest of israeli society. Kibbutz soldiers were seen as the best of the best of the IDF because of their devotion to preforming well (so they served as colonialism's best soldiers, hardly socialist). The kibbutzim themselves were run in somewhat socialist manner until the problems in the 70s and 80s, but their relationship with the outside world was very capitalistic. The kibbutzim relied both on stolen land for their farms, and the occasional super-cheap arab labor when it was needed. As well, many kibbutzim directly provided much needed capitalist tools (providing water-canons to apartheid south africa for example). As well, according to my dad, child-labor tolerated and even encouraged. Their existence in a nutshell depended on and was based around the broader colonial capitalist power(s) around it. \n",

      "Well, here's the thing: it is expensive, in some sense, for me to verify the historical claims by Moldbug. For people who know more about history (e.g. you and Hallquist), it my be easier. So let us consider the cheaper ways of seeing that Neoreactionaries are wrong:\n",
      "\n",
      " 1. Reading the Anti-Reactionary FAQ. That is very effective at convincing me that they are wrong, but then for various reasons I started reading Moldbug, and some of the point made in the Anti-Reactionary FAQ seem to be wrong when taking that into account. There are also a bunch of responses to the Anti-Reactionary FAQ, and following this argument/counterargument method leads me to the problem mentioned [here](http://squid314.livejournal.com/350090.html?page=).\n",
      "\n",
      " 2. Reactionaries don't trust academics, therefore they are wrong. This is a nice and trustworthy argument; the primary problem, though, is that if the reactionaries are right about the underlying mechanisms, you can't trust academics. In a sense, it's circular (unless you have some good reason to trust, but the problem is that everything ties into everything else).\n",
      "\n",
      " 3. As you mentioned, \"Then there’s the stuff about how leading scientists secretly know the neoreactionaries are right about the the inferiority of black people\". Now, correct me if I'm wrong, but [isn't the truth on this area still unclear?](https://www.gwern.net/Mistakes#iq-race)\n",

I have also claimed that [rationalists might be a bit too intolerant of the left, but I semi-withdrew that claim](https://www.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/3qym00/a_survey_on_gender/cwjkh6q).
